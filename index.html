    <p>  My name is Silas Oyewale. I was born in Nigeria and moved <br>
      to the US in 2010. I want to be a software <br>
      engineer so that I can use my magic power to change <br>
      the world for the better. I believe the power of   <br>                  
      engineering is boundless and can be used to better our <br>
       world. Feel free to reach out to me for any questions <br>
       you may have. Thanks.  </p>

         I play soccer, ping pong, and basketball and I am a semi-hungerated meat-eating <br>
         vegetarian. If you are wondering what that means, it means a vegetarian that eats<br>
          meat but makes sure he or she reserves space in the stomach for vegetables. </div>
